# Minecraft Renewable Datapack

## This is a datapack that aims to (eventually) make every resource in Minecraft renewable.

It is made by [Gears](https://github.com/GearsDatapacks), and aims to be as seemless with the normal game as possible, making sure every mechanic is balanced and realistic.

If you have any suggestions or questions about the datapack, please leave a comment on [Planet Minecraft](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/everything-renewable-5732485/) or the [YouTube series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWgyGZPJ8ybI63MWwyHEa-9GkAS69Of5f) and Gears will respond as soon as possible.

### **List of features so far**:
***

**Renewable Crafter**:

    This is essential for all of the crafting recipes in this datapack.

    Obtained by throwing a composter item onto a placed crafting table.

**Compressor**:

    Used for a number of different mechanics in this datapack.
    
    Crafting recipe (In the renewable crafter): 4 pistons on the edges, a redstone block in the middle and four diamonds in the corners.

**Compression**: 

    Makes diamonds and coal renewable.

    Place the compressor down then put a log/coal block in the centre of it. Then drop an anvil onto that block from at least 10 blocks in the air, and the block will turn into a coal/diamond respectively.

**Lava Transmitter**:

    Useful for injecting lava into blocks.

    Crafting recipe: Like iron leggings, but the top middle is pointed dripstone.

    Use: Place with lava above and a pointed dripstone hanging off it. Every minute any stone directly underneath that will be converted into netherrack.

**Back in the ground**:

    Every ore other than deepslate emerald and gilded blackstone can be crafted in the renewable crafter with the material's block in the middle and the stone variation it is in around the outside.
    
    (e.g. quartz is crafted with a quartz block in the middle with netherrack surrounding it).

**Back together**

    In the Renewable Crafter you can put nine of any coral to convert it into a block of that type

**Hammer**

    The hammer is used in various other renewable processes and is crafted like an iron pickaxe with two iron on the sides.

**Smashing it up**

    If you get a hammer and break any dead coral block, it will drop sand.
